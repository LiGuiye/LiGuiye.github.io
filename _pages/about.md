I'm a second-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Geography at CU Boulder, focusing on deep-learning-based geospatial uncertainty modeling and satellite imagery super-resolution. My current advisor is [Guofeng Cao](https://www.colorado.edu/geography/guofeng-cao). I got my bachelor's degree from Hubei University in China.
